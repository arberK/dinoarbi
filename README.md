# My fist website (Circa 2002)


This is a nostalgic look back at probably the first website I ever created back in 2002 when I was just 13 years old. At that age, I was utterly fascinated by dinosaurs, and I spent countless hours researching and learning about these magnificent creatures.

## A Walk Down Memory Lane

- **Preservation Challenges**: Looking back, it's clear that I didn't quite grasp the importance of preserving digital artifacts. As a result, you may encounter broken links and even the use of special Albanian characters like 'Ã«.' While I've made some efforts to repair the links, I've strived to be non-invasive, preserving the essence of my early work.

- **The Grammar Police**: You'll undoubtedly come across numerous grammatical errors throughout the website. Back then, I didn't have access to spell-checkers, online translators, or even the luxury of having the internet at home. I hope you can pardon my youthful enthusiasm and embrace the imperfections as part of the charm.

## Technical Details

- **The Tools of the Trade**: My trusty companion during this web-building adventure was my first computerâ€”an Intel Pentium II running Windows 98. The software lineup consisted of Adobe GoLive for website creation and MS Paint for any graphical endeavors. These tools, while primitive by today's standards, were my gateway to the world of web development.

I'm sharing this piece of my digital history as a reminder of where I started my journey in web development. It's a testament to the passion I had even as a young teenager and a tribute to the early days of the internet.

Please enjoy this blast from the past, and thank you for taking this trip down memory lane with me!
